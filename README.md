This is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. Using html/css and Javascript .

1)Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
2)Create the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try making them by hand with copy and pasting in your HTML file!
3)It’s best to put your grid squares inside another “container” div (which can go directly in your HTML).
4)You need make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line).
5)Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
6)Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad. Tip: Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100. A larger number of squares results in more computer resources being used, potentially causing delays, freezing, or crashing that we want to prevent.
